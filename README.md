# Weather Dashboard

 ## Paragraph 1: What was the assignment or task?
The assignment was to create a Weather Dashboard web application that allows users to search for the weather forecast of any city. The application should display the current weather conditions, including temperature, wind speed, and humidity, along with a 5-day forecast. Additionally, the project required implementing local storage to save and display a list of previously searched cities as buttons for easy access to their weather information.

## Paragraph 2: What was your motivation?
The motivation behind building this Weather Dashboard was to provide users with a convenient way to access weather information for any city. Weather is an essential aspect of daily life, and having a user-friendly application that allows users to quickly check the weather forecast for different cities can be very beneficial. The goal was to create a visually appealing and intuitive dashboard that anyone can use to stay informed about the weather conditions in their desired locations.

 ## Paragraph 3: What problem does it solve?
The Weather Dashboard solves the problem of quickly obtaining weather forecasts for different cities in an easy-to-understand format. By providing a search bar, users can enter the name of any city they want to know about, and the application fetches and displays the weather information for that location. Moreover, the project also solves the problem of remembering and accessing previously searched cities by utilizing local storage to store the list of cities and display them as buttons on the page.

## Paragraph 4: What did you learn? Why did you build this project?
Through building this Weather Dashboard project, I learned several valuable skills and concepts. Firstly, I improved my proficiency in using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a dynamic and interactive web application. Additionally, I gained experience with API integration, as I needed to fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. Implementing local storage also deepened my understanding of how to persist data in a web browser for future use.

I built this project to enhance my web development skills, particularly in handling APIs and working with local storage. Moreover, I wanted to create a practical application that serves a real-world purpose by providing users with easy access to weather forecasts for any city. The project also allowed me to explore and implement event listeners, DOM manipulation, and dynamically generating elements to create a smooth and engaging user experience.

Overall, the Weather Dashboard project was a valuable learning experience, and it allowed me to showcase my abilities in front-end web development while creating a useful application for users seeking weather information
